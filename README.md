Online Quiz Game: Description

An online quiz game is an interactive web-based game where users can answer multiple-choice questions within a given time limit, or without one, and receive feedback on their answers at the end. The game can be played individually or in a competitive format where multiple users participate in real-time. The game typically includes several rounds of questions based on various topics or categories, and users are awarded points for correct answers. The goal is to score as many points as possible or achieve the highest score in a leaderboard.
Key Features of an Online Quiz Game:

    Backend (Server-Side):
        Question Database: A set of questions stored on the server that can be retrieved dynamically. Questions can be categorized (e.g., General Knowledge, Science, History, etc.).
